# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **From Malthusian stagnation to sustained economic growth** and is about the Malthus hypothesis, which states that in pre-industrial times, increases in technological sophistication lead to an increase in population and population density in the short- and long-run, but do not permanently raise income per capita levels.

The project consists of the files modelproject.ipynb and modelproject.py.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
